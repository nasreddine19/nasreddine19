## My GitHub Projects

Feel free to explore some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Quiz App** 🎯
   "Quiz App" is a web application where users can answer questions by choosing the category, difficulty, and number of questions. It's a fun way to test your knowledge! The app is built using React.js and leverages external APIs to fetch quiz questions. It also utilizes the "react-router-dom" library for smooth navigation between different sections of the app.
